# **Robot System for Motion Tracking and Precise Parsing in Disaster Sites**



#### **Precautions**

* There are two cameras (On robot and On tracking station), but the USB number is different depending on the computer, so you have to change the number if there is a camera index error.
* At the start of the program, set the initial position to x = 0.13, and y = 0.49.
* There is a limit to the length of the robot arm. If robot attitude is out of range, there will be error 
* After Mode 2 is over, the tracking object should be set to x = 0.13, y = 0.49, before it moves to Mode 1.
